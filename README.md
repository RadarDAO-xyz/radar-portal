# Protein Onboarding Bot ðŸ¤–

>it's probably nothing

## TL;DR

A custom built bot for Protein to assist with onboarding new members.  âœ¨

## How it Works

1. Somone submits a request to join the community
2. The request is posted in `member-applications`
3. Community members respond to the request via: ðŸŸ¢ or ðŸ”´
4. The response is recorded in airtable for community managers

## Setup

1. Fork the repository to your gihub account (top right hand corner)
2. Clone the fork to your local system
3. Install Node modules `npm install`

## Submitting your improvements

1. Create a new branch `git check -b <your branch name>`
2. `git add .`
3. `git commit -m 'fix(example): semantic versioning is cool'`
4. `git push`
5. Grab that PR and point it to our main branch
6. Message with changes for a review ! :v:
