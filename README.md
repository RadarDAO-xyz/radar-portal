# RADAR portal ðŸ¤–

## TL;DR

An onboarding bot that checks an airtable whitelist for user's discord handle and then gives them a role  âœ¨

## How it Works

1. A user joins RADAR and visits the `#radar-portal` channel
2. They press the bot's button to check the whitelist
3. If they are on the list, the role is added and they gain access to the server
4. Otherwise, they are informed of further steps

## Setup

1. Fork the repository to your gihub account (top right hand corner)
2. Clone the fork to your local system
3. Install Node modules `npm install`

## Submitting your improvements

1. Create a new branch `git check -b <your branch name>`
2. `git add .`
3. `git commit -m 'fix(example): semantic versioning is cool'`
4. `git push`
5. Grab that PR and point it to our main branch
6. Message with changes for a review ! :v:
